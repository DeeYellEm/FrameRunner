# PicSlide

This module randomly chooses an image from the resources directory and it chunks the image out in smaller rectangles then drops them from off the top of the screen.  Over time they move to their column and only stop if they are in the correct location *and* the block below them is in place.  The bottom row stops simply once it's in the right location.  So, it randomly constructs the image over time via these sliding blocks.
